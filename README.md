My playground, where I practice using C++ features. This includes:
 - multithreading
 - smart pointers
 - templates
 - streams
 - lambdas
 - json handling

The project is also a place to practice CMake:
 - working with multiple CMakeLists
 - creating project which can be built on linux, windows and macos
 - downloading dependencies with FetchContent
 - enabling testing and code coverage
 - configuring CMakePresets

As well as testing with help of listed technologies:
 - ctest
 - google test
 - github actions
 - gcovr
 - coveralls
